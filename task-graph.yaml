    title: Production Deployment with Video Hosting
    description: The hacknight demo has been running locally via `bun dev`, which means it goes down when the laptop closes. All features are complete and the app is ready for production. The project already uses `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare` so Cloudflare Pages is the natural deployment target.

    story: S-009

Configure the build settings to use `bun run build` as the build command and `.svelte-kit/cloudflare` as the output directory (this is the default for adapter-cloudflare). Enable automatic deployments from the main branch.
