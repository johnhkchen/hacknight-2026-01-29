## Objective

Define what we're building. This is the design phase where we establish the project concept, technical approach, and user experience before writing any implementation code.

## Context

We're starting from a clean chassis template and need to establish the project vision. The design phase should explore possibilities, evaluate constraints, and arrive at a clear specification that guides implementation.

## Key Questions to Answer

What problem are we solving? Who is the target user and what value do they get? What makes this project compelling? What is the minimum viable product we can build in the available timeframe?

## Acceptance Criteria

We have a clear specification that describes what we're building and why. The specification includes a problem statement, proposed solution, and technical approach. We have documented the core user journey showing how someone would experience the primary value. The project has an identity with a name and clear positioning.

## Approach

Start with open exploration of ideas and constraints. Research relevant technologies and evaluate what's possible. Converge on a specific concept and validate its feasibility. Document the specification and happy path so implementation can proceed with clarity.
